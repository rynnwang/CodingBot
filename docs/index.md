## Define Business Models in C#.

## Generate C# Codes and SQL Scripts.
## Customize Your Codes
If you design correctly and select right pattern(s) to use, this auto generation can help you save at least 70% time, especially at the beginning of project cycles. You can focus on the real business logics based on existed models, methods and APIs, rather than keeping boring copy-paste and troubleshooting the stupid mistakes caused by pasting something wrong.

You can:
- Add complex logic and interfaces beyond simple CRUD operations.
- Add cache, integration or any other things which can not be predict well as pattern.
- Apply DB index or/and optimize stored procedures when data size would be crazy large.
- Any other thing you just want to do.
